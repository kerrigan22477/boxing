so the idea here is they will open a screen that will explain the game

The jist is it's a free version of the interactive fitness boxing things

so they will put up 7 colored circles in the shape of a flower, the screen will flash with one of the colors both visually and it will be spelled out and they will hit the matching circle and it'll flash to a new one. The speed will slowly increase and when they're finished they'll just hit stop

could also just have a time option. Maybe use microphone to stop it with voice? that could be a bit ambitious for now though. 

maybe different modes. One just for time, one to increase speed! 
and more as I actually test it out and see what works.
